# Smart-Revise-Bot
This is a python-based script to automate smart revise questions using the selenium module and a modified selenium module called undetected-chromedriver.

SMBot(version: int, fullscreen: bool=False) - Takes up to two inititalisation arguments, these being the chrome version and whether the chrome window should be fullscreen or not, set to False by default.

SMBot.login(username, password) - takes two arguments, the email address and password of the account being used.

SMBot.comp_questions() - this procedure attempts to answer questions using answers.json, and will add questions if no answer exists yet.

This thing is real buggy, btw
